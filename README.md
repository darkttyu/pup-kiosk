### If Dragscroll Does Not Work

If you successfully cloned the repository but dragscroll does not work, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the project**:
    - Open the terminal in the project directory.
    - Run the following command to initialize the project:
      ```bash
      npm init -y
      ```
    This will generate the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json`, and `package.json` files.

2. **Install the `dragscroll` package**:
    - Use the following command to install the `dragscroll` package:
      ```bash
      npm install dragscroll
      ```

After completing these steps, dragscroll should work as expected and you can run it by opening the Live Server, assuming that you have it installed in your Visual Studio Code.
