        The Oval alongside the Grandstand is a prominent open space on campus that serves as a versatile area for various recreational, athletic, and social activities. It is often used by students for jogging, walking, and other fitness activities, providing a place for physical exercise and relaxation. The Oval is centrally located, making it easily accessible to students, faculty, and staff. Its spacious layout makes it an ideal location for outdoor events such as sports competitions, student gatherings, and campus-wide activities, fostering a sense of community and engagement within the university.

        In addition to being a hub for physical activity, the Oval is a popular spot for informal socializing, relaxation, and student interactions. Its green surroundings, open space, and peaceful atmosphere provide a welcoming environment for students to take breaks between classes, study outdoors, or spend time with friends. The Oval also adds to the aesthetic value of the campus, offering a scenic and refreshing atmosphere that contrasts with the more urbanized areas of the university.
