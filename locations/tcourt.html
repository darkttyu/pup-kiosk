        While the tennis court is generally open to the campus community, its availability may be subject to scheduling and restrictions, particularly for formal sports events or activities. To use the court, individuals may need to reserve the space or check for availability through the university's sports or recreation office. The facility is an important part of PUPâ€™s commitment to promoting a balanced student life, encouraging physical fitness alongside academic pursuits.
