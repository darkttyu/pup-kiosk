        The Guard House at PUP Sta. Mesa serves as an exit point for security and monitoring within the university. Located at the right
        side of the main gate, it functions as a security checkpoint where all individualsâ€”students, staff, and visitors exit. security personnel monitor the flow of people and ensure that only authorized individuals exit the campus.
        <br><br>
        In addition to security checks, the Guard House also oversees the storing of documents submitted by university students, as well as documents submitted by those outside the university. The guards' role extends beyond security, offering support to ensure the campus operates smoothly while maintaining safety protocols for everyone on the premises.
