        The Gymnasium at PUP Sta. Mesa is a central facility for sports and recreational activities on campus. It is primarily used for a wide range of events, including intercollegiate sports competitions, physical education classes, and various school-wide athletic activities. The gymnasium is equipped to host different sports like basketball, volleyball, and badminton, and is frequently the venue for tournaments, practice sessions, and training for student-athletes. Additionally, it is used for large-scale events such as university-wide assemblies, concerts, and other activities that bring the PUP community together.

        Apart from supporting athletics, the PUP gymnasium also offers students and staff a place to engage in physical fitness activities and extracurricular pursuits. It plays an important role in fostering school spirit, teamwork, and a healthy lifestyle. Access to the gymnasium may be available during specific hours, with priority given to scheduled sports events or classes.

        The gymnasium is also a space for community-building, as it hosts events that extend beyond sports, contributing to the social and cultural life of the university. It is an essential part of PUPâ€™s commitment to providing a balanced and holistic education, where physical well-being is integrated with academic and social development.
