        In addition to supporting athletic and academic programs, the swimming pool is also used for university events and competitions. It may be reserved for specific events, such as intercollegiate swimming meets or university-wide recreational programs. Students and staff interested in using the pool may need to follow certain guidelines, such as designated swim hours or reservation procedures, especially during peak times. The pool offers an opportunity for students to engage in low-impact exercise, making it a valuable resource for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
